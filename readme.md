# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: David Lanigan

## Overview.
The App is a mock up of a library book system. When it's finished there will be a database of books that users can check out and return and perform all the usual operations on like add new books, delete books and modify existing books. For the initial part of this assignment, there is no back end and the data is held in a JSON file locally. Eventually this will be ported to MongoDb database and we will develop API's to handle the CRUD operations.  


 . . . . . List of user features (excluding user registration and authentication) . . . .

 + View Books
 + Add Book
 + Delete Book
 + Modify Book
 + etc

## Installation requirements.
. . . .  List of software used to develop the app . . . . . . .
+ ReactJS v15.3.0
+ Bootstrap 3
+ create-react-app tool
+ etc
+ etc

. . . . . . Also, explain (to a third party) what steps one must take to run your app after cloning it from the repository, e.g. any non-standard software installation; any environment setup; how to start app; where to view app in browser . . . . . . . At its simplest this may just be: npm install + npm start

## Data Model Design.

Diagram of app's data model (see example below) AND/OR a sample of the test data used (JSON or equivalent).

## Routing.
. . . . List each route supported and state the associated view . . . . .

+ /foos - displays all published foos
+ /foos/:id - detail view of a particular foo (:id)
+ etc
+ etc

## Extra features

. . . . . Briefly explain any non-standard features, functional or non-functional (e.g. user registration, authentication) developed for the app . . . . . .  

## Independent learning.

. . . . . State the non-standard aspects of Angular (or other related technologies) that you researched and applied in this assignment . . . . .
